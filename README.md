# cs305_Project_2


Artemis Financial required a product with industry standard security features such as a checksum verification, file and data verification and dependency checks.

I ran into a lot of roadblocks with this course and the only thing I can credit myself for is really not giving up. I think my final submission was still missing a few screenshots but I was able to log into a https://localhost. I just had to start over a few times and go from mac > PC then back to mac agine

I kept running into issues importing the cert from the cmd keytool into the java project trying to use the tomcat guide. I ended up going back to my mack and using the keychain instead. 

By using an algorithm cipher, generating a cert, dependency check, and performing a manual check, there were several layers of security.

In the future I'll spend more time watching videos of certificate creation and play with some prit debugging, also stackoverflow is always very helpful but. I had too much trouble early on to spend a lot of time with it. 

The docs are always helpful and stackoverflow are my main resources. 

I don't think I'll show this assignment, but I may use it to create something better and integrate it into a working program to display certificate generation capabilities
